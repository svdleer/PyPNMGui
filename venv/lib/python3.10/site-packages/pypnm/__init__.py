PyPNM
=====
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PPM and PGM image files reading, displaying and writing for Python >=3.4.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 Sep 2025 "Victory II" update, drop-in replacement for PyPNM 1.17.9.34
9 May 2025 "Victory" build.

Usage
-----

::

    from pypnm import pnmlpnm

to access functions.

Formats compatibility
---------------------

Module provides full read and write support for 8 and 16 bpc binary and ASCII
`PPM`_ and `PGM`_ image files, and read-only support for `PBM`_ files.

Python compatibility
--------------------

This is **py34** `PyPNM for Python >= 3.4`_ aka `PyPNM at PyPI`_ branch,
containing some workarounds for old Python and old Tkinter versions.
These workarounds make program work a bit slower under some circumstances.

If you are sure you will never use Python versions below 3.11, you may
consider downloading and using `PyPNM for Python >= 3.11`_ branch.

Copyright and redistribution
----------------------------

Written by Ilya Razmanov (https://dnyarri.github.io) to facilitate developing
image editing programs in Python by simplifying work with PPM/PGM files
and displaying arbitrary image-like data with Tkinter ``PhotoImage`` class.

Module is supposed to be used and redistributed freely, and modified at will.

In case of introducing useful modifications it's your duty to all human race
(and probably some other ones) to share it.
